    \caption{\textcolor{black}{Association of COVID-19 policies with search interest: difference-in-differences results that explore heterogeneity of results} across containment policy restrictiveness, economic support, and GDP per capita. Each coefficient comes from a separate regression. The stringency index comes from the University of Oxford COVID-19 Government Response tracker, a composite measure of the restrictiveness of policy measures. Mobility reduction comes from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which measure the percent change in mobility relative to pre-pandemic levels. Per capita GDP comes from the World Bank's World Development Indicators; we use log per capita GDP. The Economic Support index from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response tracker, which measures the extent of economic support across metrics such as income support and debt relief. We standardize all variables into z-scores---having a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. \textcolor{black}{`N' indicates the number of countries with available data. Maps produced using R, version 4.2.2 (\url{https://www.r-project.org/}); data for country boundaries come from Natural Earth (\url{https://www.naturalearthdata.com/}).}}
